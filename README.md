# Sarcasm Detection
Building a Machine Learning Model to Predict Sarcasm

The aim is to develop and evaluate a sarcasm detection model for Nigerian Pidgin Tweets.
## Introduction
Finding sarcastic statements inside a text is a difficult issue in natural language processing known as sarcasm detection. We especially concentrate on sarcasm recognition in Nigerian Pidgin text data in this paper. A widely used creole language in Nigeria and other West African nations is called Nigerian Pidgin. The goal is to create a pipeline that can correctly recognize and categorize sarcastic content in Nigerian Pidgin.
